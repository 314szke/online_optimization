    Designing online algorithms with predictions is a popular technique to go beyond the worst-case analysis for many practically relevant online problems like scheduling, caching, clustering, and ski rental. While in recent years more than 200 papers were published with learning-augmented algorithms \citep{AlgoGithub}, less than 10 considers settings involving convexity (see for example \cite{lechowicz2024onlineconversionswitchingcosts} and \cite{oki2023fasterdiscreteconvexfunction}), and (according to our knowledge) \emph{none} studies problems with non-linear objectives. For linear covering problems \cite{BamasMaggiori20:The-Primal-Dual-method} provided a unified approach through a primal-dual framework which extends the online primal-dual method by incorporating predictions. Following this research line, our paper presents competitive algorithms with predictions for \emph{non-linear} covering problems, generalizing the previous technique. We illustrate the applicability of our framework through several problems such as load balancing, energy minimization, and submodular minimization.
