\section{Conclusion}

We presented a primal-dual framework to design algorithms with predictions for non-linear problems with covering constraints.
The potential of our approach is visible through the example applications, therefore this paper provides useful ideas to incorporate predictions into algorithms.
Our framework is of interest for many high impact applications, such as load balancing, congestion management, energy minimization, and submodular minimization.

In our paper we answer an open question of \cite{BamasMaggiori20:The-Primal-Dual-method} to create a primal-dual framework for general problems with \emph{non-linear} objective functions and covering constraints.

An interesting research direction is to design algorithms for linear and non-linear packing problems.
