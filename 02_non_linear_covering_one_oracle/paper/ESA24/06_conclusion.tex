\section{Conclusion}

We presented a primal-dual framework to design algorithms with predictions for non-linear problems with covering constraints.
The potential of our approach is visible through the example applications, therefore this paper provides useful ideas to incorporate predictions into algorithms.
Our framework is of interest for many high impact applications, such as norm minimization, mixed packing and covering problems, energy minimization, and submodular minimization.

In our paper we answer two open questions.
First, we answer the question of \cite{BamasMaggiori20:The-Primal-Dual-method} to create a primal-dual framework for general problems with \emph{non-linear} objective functions and covering constraints.
Second, our work implies an \emph{optimal} competitive ratio of $O\bigl( k \cdot \log (d)\bigr)$ for the standard (without predictions) online problem of minimizing $\|C \vect{x}\|_{k}$ under covering constraints, answering an open question in \cite{NagarajanShen17:Online-Covering}. As a corollary, our algorithm provides an $O\bigl( \log m \cdot \log d \bigr)$-competitive solution to the online mixed packing and covering problem that is \emph{optimal} up to a constant factor.

An interesting research direction is to design algorithms for linear and non-linear packing problems.
