    Designing online algorithms with predictions is a recent technique for various practically relevant online problems like scheduling, caching (paging), clustering, and ski rental. \cite{BamasMaggiori20:The-Primal-Dual-method} provided a unified approach through a primal-dual framework for linear covering problems. Their framework extends the online primal-dual method by incorporating predictions, and its performance goes beyond the worst-case analysis. Following this research line, our paper presents competitive algorithms with predictions for \emph{non-linear} covering problems, generalizing the previous technique. We illustrate the applicability of our framework through several problems such as online norm minimization, online mixed packing and covering, energy minimization, and submodular minimization. Furthermore, our work implies the \emph{optimal} competitive ratios for the problems of norm minimization and mixed packing and covering in the classic online setting without predictions.
