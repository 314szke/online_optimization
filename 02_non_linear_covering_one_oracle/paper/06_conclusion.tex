\section{Conclusion}

We presented a primal-dual
framework to design algorithms with predictions for non-linear problems with covering constraints. The potential of our approach is visible through the example applications. This paper provides useful ideas to incorporate predictions into algorithms.
The framework is of interest for many high impact applications, such as load balancing, energy minimization, submodular minimization
and congestion minimization.
An interesting research direction is to design algorithms for non-linear packing problems
and also to develop competitive algorithms in the setting of multiple predictions.
