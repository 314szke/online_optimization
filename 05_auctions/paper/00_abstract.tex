    Auctions with divisible resources represent various practically relevant problems, such as network bandwidth allocation and food aid distribution. In each of these settings, the desire to receive (or the need of) a resource is represented by bids. The proportional allocation mechanism assigns a fraction of the resource to each bidder in proportion to the bid across all the bids. Despite the importance of these type of auctions, the efficiency of proportional allocations is still not completely understood. In recent years, \cite{Tardos2013} proved a lower bound of $26.8\%$ for the Price of Anarchy (PoA) considering social welfare, and \cite{Caragiannis2014} improved their analysis to $50\%$ both for social and effective welfares. This paper follows a different perspective on the analysis of this problem, which relies on the primal-dual method (first introduced in this setting by \cite{Thang2017}). We prove that the Price of Anarchy (PoA) bound considering the effective welfare of proportional allocation over coarse-correlated and Bayes-Nash equilibria in the complete information setting for a single item is $50\%$, and this result is \emph{tight}.
