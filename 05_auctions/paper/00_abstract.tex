    Auctions with divisible resources represent various practically relevant online problems, such as network bandwidth allocation and food aid distribution. In each of these settings, the desire to receive a resource is represented by bids. The proportional allocation mechanism assigns a fraction of the resource to each bidder in proportion to the bid over all the bids. In recent years, \cite{Tardos2013} proved a lower bound of $26.8\%$, and relying on similar techniques, \cite{Caragiannis2014} improved their analysis to $50\%$. This paper follows a different perspective on the analysis of this problem, which relies on the primal-dual method (first introduced in this setting by \cite{Thang2017}). We prove that the Price of Anarchy (PoA) bound of proportional allocation over coarse-correlated and Bayes-Nash equilibria in the complete information setting is for a single item is $50\%$, and this result is \emph{tight}.
