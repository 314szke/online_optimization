\section{Counter example for tight online expert solutions} \label{appix-tight-solutions}

The following example shows that we cannot expect online expert solutions (in the sense of online algorithms)
to be tight on the arriving constraints. In the example below, we display the experts' solutions after each constraint.

\begin{align*}
    \min\ \ \ \ x_{1} + \ \ \ x_{2} & \\
    x_{1} + \frac{1}{2}\ x_{2} & \ge 1 \\
    \textnormal{Expert}_{1}: \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0 & \\
    \textnormal{Expert}_{2}: \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 2 & \\
    x_{2} & \ge 1 \\
    \textnormal{Expert}_{1}: \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 & \\
    {\color{red}\textnormal{Expert}_{2}:} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {\color{red} 0} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {\color{red} 2} & \\
\end{align*}
%
To have tight a suggestion from Expert$_2$ on the second constraint, Expert$_2$ not only has to decrease its value of $x_{2}$ (which is not allowed), but even increase the value of $x_{1}$ for the first constraint. In other words, Expert$_2$ has to completely modify its past decisions.
