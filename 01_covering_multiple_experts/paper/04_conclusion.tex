\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce a dynamic \texttt{LIN-COMB} benchmark in the setting of multiple expert predictions beyond the traditional static benchmark of the best expert in hindsight
and give a competitive algorithm for the online covering problem in this benchmark.
Our approach can provide valuable insights into the learning processes related to predictions,
in particular, in aggregating information from predictions to improve the performance of existing algorithms,
and how to combine online algorithms, an important subject in the online algorithm design community \cite{AzarBroder93:On-line-Choice,BlumBurch00:On-line-Learning}.
The experiments support the fact that our algorithm can differentiate between good and adversarial experts to some extent.

An interesting open question is to design competitive algorithms in the \texttt{LIN-COMB} benchmark for different classes of problems,
such as packing problems and problems with non-linear objectives.
