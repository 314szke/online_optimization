\section{Experiments}

\textbf{Implementation.} The first step of our proposed algorithm is to solve a convex program. In the experiments, we approximate the optimal solution of this program using a vanilla Frank-Wolfe implementation. The linear minimization step within Frank-Wolfe is solved with the Gurobi optimizer.

\textbf{Comparison.} The best standard online algorithm for general covering problems without experts is the online multiplicative weight update (MWA) algorithm. In the experiments we compare our algorithm with the MWA algorithm. When a new constraint arrives in the online problem, the MWA algorithm increases each variable $x_i$ in the constraint with a rate of $\frac{a^t_i}{c_i}(x_i + 1/n)$, where $n$ is the total number of variables. We also compare our results with the optimum offline solution (that knows the whole instance in advance) and the average solution of the experts.
%On the following figures, we display both the first and the second layer execution results of our algorithm (see \cref{fig:my_label}).

\textbf{Input.} First, we evaluated the result of our algorithm on the pathological input of the MWA algorithm. This instance includes $n$ variables and $n$ constraints with uniform costs and coefficients. Each arriving constraint in this pathological example includes one less variable. While the optimal solution is $1$, the worst-case guarantee of MWA is $O(\log n)$. For our algorithm we provided $n$ experts, where $(n-1)$ experts suggest an adversarial trivial solution to set all variables to $1$, while $1$ expert suggests the optimal offline solution. The result of this experiment is visible on \cref{fig:exp-objective}. An important highlight: our algorithm managed to identify the good expert among the majority of adversaries, obtaining a better objective value, than MWA. Second, we experimented with the counter example (in Appendix~\ref{sec:counter-example}) to show that the algorithm proposed by \cite{AnandGe22:Online-Algorithms} has an incorrect performance proof. The result is visible on \cref{fig:exp-objective}. Finally, we generated some instances to observe the performance of our algorithm on non-specific inputs.
The specification for the instance generation includes several parameters, which we detail on \cref{fig:exp-params}.

\textbf{Result.} Multiplicative weight update is a simple and well-performing algorithm in practice. On its pathological worst-case example, our algorithm performs better, however on most instances the expert suggestions were significantly worse than MWA, which impacted the performance of our algorithm. To some extent, our algorithm can detect the good experts and is robust against even many adversaries. We think that given a real-life problem, it is possible to construct well-performing experts (for example using past data) and with a fine-tuned convex program solver our algorithm can be of interest for various use-cases.
