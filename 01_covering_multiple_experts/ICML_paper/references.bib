@inproceedings{BuchbinderChen14:Competitive-Analysis,
	abstract = {We provide a framework for designing competitive online algorithms using regularization, a widely used technique in online learning, particularly in online convex optimization. An online algorithm that uses regularization serves requests by computing a solution, in each step, to an objective function involving a smooth convex regularization function. Applying the technique of regularization allows us to obtain new results in the domain of competitive analysis. We remark that competitive analysis and online learning are two widely studied frameworks for online decision-making settings. We show that even though there are significant differences in assumptions, goals, and techniques between the two fields, one can still benefit by introducing techniques from one field to the other.In our new framework we exhibit a general O(log m)-competitive deterministic algorithm for generating a fractional solution that satisfies a time-varying set of online covering and precedence constraints, where m is the number of variables. This framework allows to incorporate both service costs (over time) and setup costs into a host of applications. We then provide an O(log m log n)-competitive randomized algorithm for the online set cover problem with service cost, where m is the number of sets and n is the number of elements. This model allows for sets to be both added and deleted over time from a solution.},

  abstract = 	 {We study the online load balancing problem with machine learned predictions, and give results that improve upon and extend those in a recent paper by Lattanzi et al. (2020). First, we design deterministic and randomized online rounding algorithms for the problem in the unrelated machine setting, with $O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$- and $O(\frac{\log \log m}{\log \log \log m})$-competitive ratios. They respectively improve upon the previous ratios of $O(\log m)$ and $O(\log^3\log m)$, and match the lower bounds given by Lattanzi et al. Second, we extend their prediction scheme from the identical machine restricted assignment setting to the unrelated machine setting. With the knowledge of two vectors over machines, a dual vector and a weight vector, we can construct a good fractional assignment online, that can be passed to an online rounding algorithm. Finally, we consider the learning model introduced by Lavastida et al. (2020), and show that under the model, the two vectors can be learned efficiently with a few samples of instances.}
